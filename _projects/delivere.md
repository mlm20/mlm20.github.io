<em>DeliverE was a group project, developed in a team of four, as part of the 'Sustainable Design Engineering' module, part of the Design Engineering (MEng) course at Imperial College London.</em>

DeliverE is a novel product-service system (PSS) developed to improve the sustainability of takeaway food packaging via a closed-loop system that works with minimal effort from users, a durable and more sustainable container, and a digital tracking system.
