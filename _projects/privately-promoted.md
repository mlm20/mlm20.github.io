<em>PrivatelyPromoted was a group project, developed in a team of four, as part of the 'Design Engineering Futures' module, part of the Design Engineering (MEng) course at Imperial College London.</em>

PrivatelyPromoted envisions a future where all data is private and where targeted advertising does not work without the explicit authorisation of the user. PrivatelyPromoted is a new marketplace promoting user centred targeted advertising.
