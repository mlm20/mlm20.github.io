Hey there, I'm Max! I'm an engineering (MEng) graduate from Imperial College London and currently work as Design Engineer at Terra API (YC W21) in London.

I work at the intersection of engineering and design to conceptualise, design, and ship world-class products that are a joy to use, are technically sound, and solve real problems.

At Terra most of my time is split between product design and frontend development. I work fully end-to-end, starting by understanding user needs, conceptualising solutions (I'm a big fan of pen and paper), creating pixel-perfect designs in Figma, and finally building and shipping frontend code using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. 

I graduated with an MEng in Design Engineering from Imperial College. There, I completed 11 team-based and 10 individual engineering and design projects, covering areas including mechanical design (CAD), software development (mostly Web), rapid prototyping (laser cutting, 3D printing, workshop skills, etc.), mechatronics (Esp32, Arduino, etc.), and UX and system design (Figma). 

At Imperial I was also very active in student life (awarded Union Colours). I was elected President and Events Officer of Imperial's LGBTQ society, leading a 12-member team and running weekly events. I was also head of events and a DJ tutor for Imperial's electronic music society!

During my degree I did a 6 month internship in Germany at REHAU New Ventures, the corporate venture builder of a â‚¬3.4B turnover Mittelstand firm. The work was fully in German and I picked up a bunch of useful venture and entrepreneurship skills.

tl;dr, I like building cool stuff :)
